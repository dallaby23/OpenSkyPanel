If you do not know much about Arduino and ESP32 then this project 'might' be a bit much but I will leave that to you.
Download all the files with the 'data' directory to a location on your computer.
Open the Rebel_EFIS_V4.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
I will be adding all the required libraries here soon but for now if you know Arduino you can just look at the #includes to get them.
I used 2MB APP and 2MB SPIFFS no OTA for the partition size. (the program will require larger than the default of 1.2MB)
After uploading the main program to the ESP32 you will need to upload the webpages in the 'data' directory.
The partition is using LittleFS so therefore you need to install the LittleFS Upload utility. I followed this link. https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-ide-2-install-esp32-littlefs/ 
Once that is installed you simply (close Serial monitor if open) hold Shift+Ctrl and press P. A menu will popup and you can search for 'Upload LittleFS to ESP32' once you select that the upload will happen automatically.
After that completes you should be able to connect to the internal Wifi at Rebel_AP with no password. The default IP is 192.168.10.5.
So connect to http://192.168.10.5 or optionally http://efis.local 
I will be providing a tuturial video in the near future but if you are having trouble you can reach out to me directly.
